          Emily is also a native Iowan, born in Fairfield in 1988. She grew up on a farm just north of Fairfield and spent her childhood playing outside with the family dog and inside with her books and Barbie adventures, along with practicing piano and later tenor saxophone and organ. After discovering her love of theatre through middle school and high school, she pursued a theatre degree at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, in addition to studying history and English. Her music background and theatrical passion combined when she discovered sound design. Theatre internships in A/V led her to spend her summers further and further from home - first the fledgling Des Moines Social Club, then Indiana (no offense, but itâ€™s The Worst&trade;) and the stunning mountains and sunsets of Sante Fe, New Mexico.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
          For the last 10 or so years, Emily lived in Boston, where she worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Office of Corporate Relations, by day and then played around creatively as Sound Designer for the most awesome improv group ComedyCazi by night.

          David was born handsome, and destined for medical school, in Iowa City in 1991. He spent 13 of the first 18 years of his life with his nose stuck in a book and his head in the clouds. After graduating from West High School he double majored in Computer Science and Molecular Biology at Cornell College where he also participated heavily in string music and Tent Have.

        In 2014 Emily and David met in Kendall Square, Cambridge, where they both worked, introduced by groomsman Justin Bradfield. Together, they explored Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Mexico City, Israel, Western Portugal, Southern France, and many other places, and they created their own lovely community of fantastic, supportive friends. In fall 2021, they plan on building a new home together in Massachusetts.

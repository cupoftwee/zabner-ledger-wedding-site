            The gift we most want is your presence at our wedding, either via zoom or in person and your well wishes and love.<br>
            We are excited to start our new life together! Because we are moving this fall, we have not registered for a whole home's worth of goods and furniture. We would find cash gifts useful to help fill our new home with larger, more traditional registry items when we are ready to use them.<br>
            If you want to send us a gift electronically, please venmo @David-Zabner-1
